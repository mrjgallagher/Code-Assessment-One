# Code-Assessment-One

A small piece of demonstration code written in 2/3 hours. The aim of this code snippet is to demonstrait my knowledge of java 8, and my ability to write clean, decoupled, object oriented code.

This was interesting as it was my first time using Gradle ! I may now be converted !

##Instructions :
1.Run >$ Gradle clean build 

2.Start up db
hsqldb-2.4.1\hsqldb>java -cp lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 file:data/mydb --dbname.0 Test

3.Set Main.java as your main class, and add logs.txt as an input argument.

## Next Steps to improve this code, if given more time :

1.Write more unit tests

2.Write a Base class for handling Database Connections.

3.Improve error handling flows, and increase error logging output detail.
